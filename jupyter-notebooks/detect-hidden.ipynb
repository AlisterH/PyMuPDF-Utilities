    "# Example: Detect Hidden Text\n",
    "With its v1.19.0, PyMuPDF has added a ways to detect whether object cover or hide other objects. For example in a legal context it is especially interesting to know whether there exists text that only **_appears_** to be deleted by some black rectangle - resulting in insufficiently protected personal data. Do have a look at the [this]() project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script looks for text on a PDF page that is only hidden by some drawing - as opposed to being truly deleted. The page contains three occurrences of the word \"estate\" covered by black rectangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There also exist other drawings and text occupying the same space, but in these cases the text is **_above_** the drawings and are therefore accepting as harmless."
