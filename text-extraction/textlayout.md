# Layout-preserving Text Extraction

Script `textlayout.py` extracts text from the pages of a document to a text file with the same name and file extension `.txt` in the same folder.

It strives to position the text in a layout as close to the original as possible. Thus surrounding areas where there are images, or reproducing text in tables and multi-column text.

In this folder you find an example 1-page PDF and the corresponding text output for your review.
