This folder contains scripts for document conversions.

Over time, more examples will be added. Currently there are:

* `make-cbz.py` - convert any document to a Comic Book
* `make-imagepdf.py` - convert any document to a PDF with original pages rendered to images.


Your contribution is welcome. This may include more conversion types, or improvements like better handling / supporting parameters of existing scripts.
