This folder contains scripts for document conversions.

Over time, more examples will be added. Currently there are:

* `make-cbz.py` - convert any document to a Comic Book
* `make-imagepdf.py` - convert any document to a PDF with original pages rendered to images.
* `make-page-images.py` - convert the pages of any document to PNG images.
* `images-to-ocr-pdf.py` - make PDF from a list of images (one image per page), where each page contains an OCR text layer.


Your contribution is welcome. This may include more conversion types, or improvements like better handling / supporting parameters of existing scripts.
